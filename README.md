# Intro to TDD

To get started, make sure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Then, clone this
repository, cd to the folder, and run `vagrant up`.

Once that's done, `vagrant ssh`, cd to `/vagrant` and run
`ruby calculator_test.rb`. If you see output about assertions, everything
is working.
