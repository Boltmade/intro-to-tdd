# Intro to TDD

To get started, make sure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Then, clone this
repository, cd to the folder, and run `vagrant up`.

Once that's done, `vagrant ssh`, cd to `/vagrant` and run `rake`. If you see
output about a pending test, everything is working.
