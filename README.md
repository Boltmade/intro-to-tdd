# Intro to TDD

To get started, make sure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Then, clone this
repository, cd to the folder, and run `vagrant up`.

Once that's done, `vagrant ssh`, cd to `/vagrant` and run
`ruby calculator_test.rb`. You should see output that looks like this:

```
# Running tests:



Finished tests in 0.000756s, 0.0000 tests/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.

0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

If that's what you got, you're good to go!
